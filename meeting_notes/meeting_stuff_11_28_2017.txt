On this project you can work in pairs. Due December 1st.


Design a database for storing information about medical doctors, their patients, and ilnesses:

[Done]
1. Draw its E-R diagram.

    doctors(employee_id*, first_name, last_name)
    patients(patient_id*, first_name, last_name, phone, address, city, notes)
    vitals(foregin(appointment_id), foregien(patient_id), weight, bp, height, pulse)
    illnesses(unique_id*?, name, treatment, symptoms)
    check-up(appointment_number, date-time, patient_id, doctor_id)
    specialty(doctor_id, illness_id*?)
    infected/infects(patient_id, illness_id*?)

[IF we have time, libre draw or vizio] - 11/21/2017 - Stuart

[Done] 
2. Give a relational representation of the E-R diagram that allows for 2 
functional preserving and lossless join decompositions. Describe its functional dependencies.
    For 11/15/2017 Stuart will have this
    
[Done]
3. Give the two decompositions and prove that they are lossless join and 
functional preserving.
    For 11/15/2017 Stuart will have this

[DONE]
4. Give the SQL DDLs for creating the three versions of the database.
    1 create_1.sql - DONE
    2 create_2.sql - DONE
    3 create_3.sql - DONE

[Done]
5. Fill the first database with data (at least 100 columns in each table).
    1 insert_1.sql - DONE

[Done]
6. Give the SQL queries to copy the data from the first version into its 2 decompositions.
    1.db_1_update_to_2.sql - DONE
    2.db_1_update_to_3.sql - DONE

[Done]
7. Propose in english 3 queries that require at least 2 table joins each and such that all 
tables are involved in at least 2 queries.
    1. plain_english_queries.txt - DONE (Contains Query 1 and Query 2)
    2. Query 3 - DONE

[Done]
8. Propose SQL implementations of the 3 queries on all three versions of the database.
    1. sql_queries_1.sql DONE
    2. sql_queries_2.sql DONE
    3. sql_queries_3.sql DONE


*9.* Test the time in ns for exeuting the 3 queries on each database, by running each of them 1000 times.
    1.  11/24/2017
    2.  11/24/2017
    3.  11/24/2017

Submit the databases populated with data, a file for each ddl (d.ddl, d1.ddl, d2.ddl), and a 
report with a separate section for which of the above points.
