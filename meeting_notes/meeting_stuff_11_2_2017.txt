On this project you can work in pairs. Due December 1st.


Design a database for storing information about medical doctors, their patients, and ilnesses:

1. Draw its E-R diagram.

    doctors(employee_id*, first_name, last_name)
    patients(patient_id*, first_name, last_name, phone, address, city, notes)
    vitals(foregin(appointment_id), foregien(patient_id), weight, bp, height, pulse)
    illnesses(unique_id*?, name, treatment, symptoms)
    check-up(appointment_number, date-time, patient_id, doctor_id)
    specialty(doctor_id, illness_id*?)
    infected/infects(patient_id, illness_id*?)

2. Give a relational representation of the E-R diagram that allows for 2 
functional preserving and lossless join decompositions. Describe its functional dependencies.

3. Give the two decompositions and prove that they are lossless join and 
functional preserving.

4. Give the SQL DDLs for creating the three versions of the database.

5. Fill the first database with data (at least 100 columns in each table).

6. Give the SQL queries to copy the data from the first version into its 2 decompositions.


7. Propose in english 3 queries that require at least 2 table joins each and such that all 
tables are involved in at least 2 queries.

8. Propose SQL implementations of the 3 queries on all three versions of the database.

9. Test the time in ns for exeuting the 3 queries on each database, by running each of them 1000 times.

Submit the databases populated with data, a file for each ddl (d.ddl, d1.ddl, d2.ddl), and a 
report with a separate section for which of the above points.
